      %p
        I am a front end developer by day... and a front end developer by night. My profession is my passion and way of life. I do not consider what I do a job. I continue working on personal projects after my normal work day. I strive to be challenged and am very self motivated. I am currently learning Ruby on Rails and have experience in most current frameworks including bootstrap, foundation and the semantic grid system. I feel obligated to stay up-to-date on ALL of the latest design and development trends on the internet to effectively keep my projects fresh and future proof. My goal is to be an asset to your company and wear multiple hats and help streamline projects.
